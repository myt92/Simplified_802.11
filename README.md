# Simplified_802.11
This is a matlab project of a simplified end-to-end 802.11 simulation from my course EL-6023 Wireless Communication

## 1. System description
In this final project, we put everything together and build an end-to-end system. The packet structure is shown below and we will use OFDM modulation with parameters similar to the 802.11 parameters.
